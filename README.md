“Memorimage” is a game that tests the player's memory with displays several images that the player must remember. This game consists of 5 screens, namely the login screen, main screen, game screen, results screen, and high score screen. We use Flutter and Dart to create this game by implementing basic algorithms, logics, drawers, navigations, animations, and shared preferences.
